# RFID-based-door-lock-suinf-arduino
This project aims to create a door lock system that utilizes RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology to grant access to authorized users. An RFID reader reads unique identification tags/cards and compares them with a pre-defined list of authorized tags. If a match is found, the door lock mechanism is triggered to unlock the door.
